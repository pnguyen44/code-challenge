// Birthday Cake Candles

// You are in charge of the cake for your niece's birthday and have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of her total age.
// When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.
// Your task is to find out how many candles she can successfully blow out.
//
// For example, if your niece is turning 4 years old, and the cake will have 4 candles of height 4, 4, 1, 3,
// she will be able to blow out 2 candles successfully, since the tallest candles are of height 4  and there are 2 such candles.
//
//
// Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the number of candles she can blow out.
//
// birthdayCakeCandles has the following parameter(s):
//
// ar: an array of integers representing candle heights

function birthdayCakeCandles(ar) {
    const max = Math.max.apply(null, ar)
    console.log(max);
    return ar.filter((x) => x === max).length
}


console.log(birthdayCakeCandles([82, 49, 82, 82, 41, 82, 15, 63, 38, 25])) // 4
